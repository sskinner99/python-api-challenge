# As final considerations:

# You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
# You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
# For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

Based on the random data of cities obtained, following observations can be made:
1. As we move towards equator the temperature gets warmer
2. As you move away from the equator towards NORTH (positive latitude) the temperature drops or cools down as compared to the temperature on SOUTH (negative latitude). NOTE: This might be because we have Max temperature taken into consideration.
3. The latitude has no discernible relationship with cloudiness & wind speed

For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
# You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
## For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.
